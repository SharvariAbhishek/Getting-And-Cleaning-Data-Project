#Getting And Cleaning Course Project

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

As part of this project below has been submitted:
1. A Tidy dataset
2. Link to github repo which contains a script `run_analysis.R` with performance analysis.
3. A codebook having the explaination on project

run_analysis.R script does the following things:
1. Downloads dataset zip file from the URL [Datase URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and unzip the zip file
2. Merges the training and test data sets using `rbind` and `cbind` to create one dataset
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement from the dataset.
4. Uses descriptive names from activity dataset to name the activities in the merged dataset.
5. Approriately names the merged dataset column names with descriptive variable names.
6. creates a independent tidy data set with the average of each variable  for each activity and subject in the dataset.

#Variables

- `fileUrl` : URL to download the zip file which contains datasets.

- `path_url` : path to directory containing unzipped datasets.

- `path_train` and `path_test` : path to subdirectories containing train and test datasets. 

- `features`, `activity`, `subject_train`, `subject_test`, `X_train`, `X_test`, `Y_train`, `Y_test` are the datasets extracted from the downloaded files present in the UCI HAR Dataset.

- `X_data`, `Y_data` and `subject_data` are the merged datasets from the individual  training and testing datasets: X, Y, subject.

- `final_data` is the dataset merged using `features`, `subject_data`, `Y_data` and `X_data`.

- `average_data` dataset contains the average of each variable for each activity and subject in the `final_data` dataset.
